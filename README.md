What this is
I use web pomodoro timers like https://pomodorotimerapp.com frequently. But when I really want to focus I want to close my browser completly. For this I created a simple pomodoro timer that I can run in my console. I tell it to start the timer, the duration and it notifies me once the timer has completed. Thats it, it works great

How to install
1. Download the pomodoro.py file to your local harddrive
2. Make sure you have python installed
3. Navigate to the location of the pomodoro.py file
4. rund python pomodoro.py in the terminal
